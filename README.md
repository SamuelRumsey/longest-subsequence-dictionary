# Longest Subsequence Dictionary

The Google *Tech Dev Guide* offers a [former coding interview question](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/foundational/find-longest-word-in-dictionary-that-subsequence-of-given-string/#code-challenge) in which you need to find the longest subsequence of a string within a list of strings.

This repository contains my solution to the problem and relevant unit tests.
